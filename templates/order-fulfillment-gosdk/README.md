# Nextmv order fulfillment template

This is a Integer Programming model to solve the order fulfillment problem.

The order fulfillment problem is a typical decision problem in e-commerce and
the retailer industry. It needs to be determined which distribution centers
are used and which carriers should be considered for the transportation of
the order to the customer. Of course these are not all aspects of the order
fulfillment problem, but these decisions will be the focus of this model.

The most important files created are `main.go` and `input.json`.

* `main.go` implements a MIP knapsack solver.
* `input.json` is a sample input file that follows the input definition in
`main.go`.

Run the command below to see if everything works as expected:

```bash
nextmv sdk run . -- -runner.input.path input.json \
  -runner.output.path output.json -solve.duration 10s
```

A file `output.json` should have been created with a solution to the order fulfillment problem.

## Next steps

* Open `main.go` and read through the comments to understand the model.
* API documentation and examples can be found in the [package
  documentation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/nextmv-io/sdk/mip).
* Further documentation, guides, and API references about custom modelling and
deployment can also be found on our [blog](https://www.nextmv.io/blog) and on
