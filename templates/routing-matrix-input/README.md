# Nextmv matrix input generation for the routing template

This template contains two apps, `input-gen` and `routing`.

* `input-gen` serves as an input generator for the routing app. The input data
  includes matrices for distance and travel time using OSRM. You can simply
  exchange the client for one of our other matrix providers: Routingkit, Google
  and Here.
* `routing` is a modeling kit for vehicle routing problems (VRP). This template
  will get you up to speed deploying your own solution while using a custom
  matrix the is previously being generated as input data for the model.
  The `routing/main.go` file is set up to consume the input file generated by
  `input-gen`.

To run both apps combined, you should look at two things:

* add the OSRM server to `input-gen/main.go` (or use a different provider of
  your choice)
* use locations in the input data in `input-gen/main.go` that can be consumed by
  your OSRM server.
  
Then simply run the run script in the root folder:

```bash
sh run.sh
```

Two files should have been created, `input-gen/routing-input.json` and
`output.json` with a VRP solution based on the matrix generated from the
`input-gen` app.
To debug any of the two apps, open the workspace files located in the folders
`input-gen` or `routing`, respectively.
