// Package kmeans provides a general interface for running a K-means
// algorithm. K-means is a clustering algorithm that divides a group of
// data points into k clusters, where k is a predefined number. The goal
// is to partition the data points into clusters such that the sum of the
// squared distances between each data point and the centroid of its cluster
// is minimized.
